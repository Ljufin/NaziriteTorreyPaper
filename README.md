# All the Days of His Righteousness:
## The Sanctity of the Nazirite Vows

This is possibly the worst Torrey paper that I've written to date. Thus, I uploaded it so that world may see a half-baked idea turn,
with a lot of hard work and perseverance, into a similarly half-baked paper. 

Just kidding, I really didn't upload this paper because I thought it was bad. It is bad, but I spent a really long time getting Turabian
formatting working in LaTeX and I really don't want to figure it all out again. Thus is the fate of a once noble idea, doomed to forever be
an organ donor for other, hopefully better, papers.
